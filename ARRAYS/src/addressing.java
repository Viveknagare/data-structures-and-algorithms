/*addressing of array
1d array = base address+(index of element - lower bound)*size of the data type

2d array suppose for i=2 ,2nd row and j=2,2nd column element
base address+((i-lowerbound)*total no of coulumns+(j-lowerbound))*size of data type
this is for row major order and for column major order it will be exactly opposites
